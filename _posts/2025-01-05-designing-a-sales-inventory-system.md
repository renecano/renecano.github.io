title: "Designing a Sales & Inventory System with Streamlit"
date: 2025-01-05
categories: blog projects
---

One of my main projects so far has been the design and development of a **Sales & Inventory Registration System** using **Streamlit**.

The goal was to build a **simple but functional system** that could realistically be used by small businesses to keep track of products and sales.

---

## The problem
Many small businesses still rely on notebooks or spreadsheets to manage inventory and sales.  
This often leads to:
- Human errors  
- Inconsistent records  
- Lack of visibility into sales performance  

I wanted to explore how a **lightweight web application** could solve this problem using accessible tools.

---

## Project objectives
The main objectives of the project were:
- Register products in a structured way  
- Log sales quickly and easily  
- Display basic metrics and summaries  
- Keep the interface clean and intuitive  

The system needed to be practical, not overly complex.

---

## Technologies used
For this project, I chose the following stack:

- **Streamlit** for the web interface  
- **Python** for application logic  
- **SQL / PostgreSQL** for data persistence  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

Streamlit allowed me to focus more on **logic and usability** instead of frontend complexity.

## System features
Some of the key features implemented include:

- Product registration with category and location  
- Sales logging linked to existing products  
- Automatic stock updates  
- Simple dashboards showing totals and trends  
- Clean UI optimized for fast interaction  

These features were designed to reflect real operational needs.

## Challenges and decisions
One of the main challenges was balancing **simplicity vs. functionality**.

I had to decide:
- What data was essential  
- What could be automated  
- What should remain manual for flexibility  

Designing the database structure early helped avoid future issues as the system grew.

## What I learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Designing data-driven applications  
- Structuring backend logic  
- Connecting user actions to persistent data  
- Thinking from a real user’s perspective  

It reinforced the importance of building **usable systems**, not just technically correct ones.

---

## Next steps
Future improvements for this project include:
- User authentication  
- More advanced analytics  
- Better reporting and visualizations  
- Performance and scalability improvements  

This project continues to evolve as I learn more.
