As a **Computer Technologies Engineering (ITC)** student, I’ve learned that the best way to truly understand software and engineering concepts is by building **real, functional projects**.

In my journey so far, I’ve worked on projects involving:
- Data-driven applications  
- Backend systems  
- IoT prototypes  
- Visualization and simulation tools  

Each project has helped me move beyond theory and understand how decisions, trade-offs, and design choices affect real systems.

## Why a technical blog?
This blog is a place where I’ll share:
- How I design and structure my projects  
- Technical challenges I face and how I solve them  
- What I learn while studying software, data, and engineering  

My goal is to document my learning process and create a knowledge base that reflects my growth as an engineer.

## What’s next?
Upcoming posts will cover topics such as:
- Designing a sales & inventory system with Streamlit  
- Lessons learned from building an IoT monitoring system  
- Visualizing concurrency using Fork/Join and DAGs  

Thanks for reading.
