## Hi, I'm René Cano 👋

I’m a **Computer Technologies Engineering (ITC)** student at *Tecnológico de Monterrey* who builds **real-world software and engineering projects** focused on data, systems, and applied technology.

I’m especially interested in turning **theory into practical solutions** through hands-on development.

### 🔹 What I build
- Data-driven applications and dashboards  
- Backend systems and software tools  
- IoT prototypes and monitoring systems  
- Visual and interactive engineering solutions

### 🔹 Featured Work
Here are some projects that represent my work and learning journey:

- **Sales & Inventory System (Streamlit)**  
  A practical web app for small businesses with data persistence and analytics.  
  👉 See project and technical breakdown in **Projects** and **Blog**

- **IoT Plant Monitoring System**  
  End-to-end IoT solution using ESP8266, MQTT, Flask, and SQLite.  
  👉 Full system explanation available in the **Blog**

- **Fork/Join DAG Visualizer (JavaFX)**  
  Interactive visualization of parallel execution using DAGs and Fork/Join.
